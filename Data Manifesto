Data Manifesto

How to find projects
  Learn the business better than the business
  Stratify discussions with people by organizational level to gain full perspective
  Focus on an organization’s inputs and outputs and how they relate to KPIs
  
How to prioritize projects
  Is anyone asking for it, and what is the estimated ROI?
  High ROI projects often require governance and change management
  Value is defined by the business, not the sophistication of the solution
  Understand risk and reward and diversify your project portfolio
  Only develop projects you are committed to sustaining unless there is a predefined transition plan to another team and they are part of development

How to get projects done
  Outline the likely project lifecycle
  Review understanding and approach before writing and reviewing code
  Regularly discuss new and ongoing projects to promote collaboration, consolidation, and self-organizing teams
  Knowledge management won’t make you succeed, but it can make you fail
  If work is not reproducible, testable, and tested, it shouldn’t be deployed
  If work is deployed, it must be monitored and sustained
  Understand project lifecycles and know when and how to end lower ROI work

How to build a data science team
  Diversity is what brings a team to life
  Key Roles: 1) Business Analyst (defines what to build), 2) Data Engineer (builds the data foundation), 3) Machine Learning Engineer (builds data artifacts), and 4) DevOps (makes solution actually work)
  Focus on delivering value, as defined by the business, not infrastructure
  After value has been delivered, invest in infrastructure to scale, automate, and solve more valuable problems
  Scale is usually achieved with better systems and better people, not more people
  Track decisions and actions that align with ROI, not lines of code
  Don’t try to be IT, be the business

What does long-term success look like? 
  The line between business and data science teams is blurred and eventually disappears entirely with automated intelligence
  Human interaction with business processes is by design, not default
